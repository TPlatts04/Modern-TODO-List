**DEVELOPER NOTES**

1. Project uses HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, BootStrap, JQuery
2. Project will be a Modernised TODO List Application

18/01/2024:
Focused on the "Add List" button, created a pop-up which asks the user to enter a title for their new desired list. This will also force the user to enter a sufficient name which meets the given criteria within the pop-up.
Coded the cancel button to ensure that the user can exit out of the "Add List" pop-up message.
Coded so the confirm button within the pop-up is disabled when one of the criterias are not met.

NOTES FOR TOMORROW:
Code the confirm button within the pop-up, so user can create a new list with their given input
Code the "10 List Limit" within the side navigation bar
