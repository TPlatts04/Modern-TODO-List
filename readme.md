# This is an UNFINISHED PROJECT

At some point in the future i will come back to this project, however i want to focus on other, more major projects which i shall begin creating.
This project is fun to work on and i will for sure come back to it.
It was created with: HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, BootStrap, Jquery.

# Personal thoughts about Project

I want to start by saying that i understand that the project is not looking it's best when it comes to UX, however that is something i will change when i come back to work on it.
There is not much left to do on this project, only creating the events which users want to add, letting them clear the events list, and deleting lists that they do not need anymore.
One major feature which i will focus on when coming back to this project is the creation of a new page when a given list is selected.

I made sure to provide my design and notes within this project if anyone would like to give me any ideas within this repo, or have a go at completing it for yourself.
This project will be live as a website at:
